## Blueberry quests

Blueberry Quests, commonly referred to as **BBQs**, are repeatable tasks issued within the Terrarium of the Blueberry academy. These are a variety of different tasks you can complete to gain Blueberry Points (**BP**), the currency used in the academy.

You can have three tasks active at any given time, and additionally, you'll unlock a **Strong Quest** if you complete 10 Blueberry Quests, which upon completion will reward more BP. As you complete quests, you'll unlock higher levels of quests. You'll know you've unlocked them whenever Director Cyrano contacts you to let you know.

It's good to know that completing quests as a group (via Union Circle) will also unlock **Group Quests** (after completing 3 Strong Quests in a group). Group Quests reward the most BP per quest by far.

If a quest is not your cup of tea, you can even **reroll** it into another one at the cost of some BP:
 
 - Regular quest:     10 BP
 - Strong quest:      50 BP
 - Group quest:       99 BP
