As this is the first post, I'd like this to be my greeting to you.

I'm the original Tophat and started this as a side-project,
as a log to store my gaming history, keep track of achievements and such.

Therefore you're very welcome to join me on Twitch whenever I'm live:
https://www.twitch.tv/glitchdefinitely

I hope this website can help out in whatever you're looking for.
